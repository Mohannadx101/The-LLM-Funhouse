# vibe-coded-projects

This is a personal, living repository dedicated to exploring the practice of Vibe Codingâ€”using AI code generation to build projects.

The goal is to test how quickly and effectively functional apps can be built by translating natural language prompts (the 'vibe') directly into code. This is an experiment focused on speed over perfection and process documentation.

Feel free to open an Issue if you have a fun, fast project idea that would be perfect for a vibe-coded experiment!
